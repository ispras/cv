# Continuous Verification Framework

[![Apache 2.0 License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

This framework aims at results analysis of continuous verification, which can be applied to software systems.

## Visualization of verification results

### Witness Visualizer

Witness Visualizer converts generic witnesses from [SV-COMP](https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org) tools into user-friendly format.

#### Requirements

Python (version>=3.4), python modules:
```shell
sudo pip3 install requests ujson graphviz ply pytest atomicwrites more-itertools pluggy py attrs setuptools six django psycopg2 pycparser sympy
```

#### Deployment

In order to install Witness Visualizer in the `<deployment directory>` execute the following command:

```bash
make install-witness-visualizer DEPLOY_DIR=<deployment directory>
```

#### Usage

After deployment Witness Visualizer can be used to convert witnesses from the `<deployment directory>` with command:

```
<deployment directory>/scripts/visualize_witnesses.py OPTIONS
```

Primary options:
* `-w` WITNESS, `--witness` WITNESS: path to the witness to be visualized;
* `-d` DIRECTORY, `--directory` DIRECTORY: directory with witnesses to be visualized (either `-w` or `-d` option must be specified);
* `-r` RESULT_DIR, `--result-dir` RESULT_DIR: directory, in which visualized witnesses will be placed in html format;
* `-s` SOURCE_DIR, `--source-dir` SOURCE_DIR: source files directory;
* `--dry-run`: do not visualize witnesses, only check their quality;
* `-u`, `--unzip`: unzip archives with visualized witnesses.

For example:

```bash
<deployment directory>/scripts/visualize_witnesses.py --witness output/witness.graphml --result-dir results/ --source-dir ~/sv-benchmarks
```

There are some examples of [SV-COMP](https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org) witnesses in the `docs/examples/witnesses` directory,
which can be used to validate Witness Visualizer installation.

### Benchmark Visualizer

Benchmark Visualizer is a tool for visualizing benchmark verification results.

#### Deployment

1. Web-interface 

See instruction [docs/web_interface.txt](docs/web_interface.txt).

2. Control scripts

In order to install Benchmark Visualizer in the `<deployment directory>` execute the following command:

```shell
make install-benchmark-visualizer DEPLOY_DIR=<deployment directory>
```

#### Usage

See instruction [docs/benchmark_visualizer.md](docs/benchmark_visualizer.md).

## Filtering of witnesses

Multiple Error Analysis (MEA) stands for semi-automatic violation witnesses filtering.
This framework provides part of MEA, which performs automatic filtering.
In order to do it, some core elements are extracted from a violation witness by means of
a specified `conversion` function and then compared with core elements of other witnesses
by means of a specified `comparison` function.

#### Deployment
MEA library can be installed in the `<deployment directory>` with the following command:
```shell
make install-mea DEPLOY_DIR=<deployment directory>
```

#### Usage
```shell
<deployment directory>/scripts/filter.py -d <directory with violation witnesses>
```
All unique violation witnesses will be printed as a result.
